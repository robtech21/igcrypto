# PSA: Instagram Crypto scams and Other Scams and How to Stay Safe

This is a guide I wrote to raise awareness about accounts being stolen, because it's happening more and more frequently in recent days. If you want a credible news article, [here's one from ABC 30](https://abc30.com/instagram-scam-bitcoin/11240519/) that kinda gave me the push to make this.

## How they work

It's really simple: the attacker (usually another stolen account) gets you to send them a link that shows up in your SMS or email, **this is from Instagram, however it's a password reset link,** which can be used against you to lock you out of your account.

## How to recognize them and avoid early

**The best practice to avoid this is to always turn on two-factor authentication**

You can do this by going to `settings -> security -> two-factor authentication` 

### Suspicious stories

Avoid all accounts that have stories that advertise an account called `crypto_with_daisy`

### Change of username

The username will change to something similar to the original, usually with characters or numbers added. A likely explaination could be that it makes it harder for the original owner to get the account back.

## What they look like

It may start out with a simple "hey" or "hi" from an account you follow, but avoid contact when talking to the user when they say any of these things:

<br>

### "I'm so sad rn"

This one takes advantage of you mentally, here's how the conversation goes from my experience:

> Hey

"Hello"

> I'm so sad rn

(This is likely where you should just stop messaging them)

"That's unfortunate"

> This s**t ain't working yet am so sad rn FRFR feel like cam stock and dumb right Iâ€™m so sad

"You've lost me"

> I bought a new iPhone I wanna log in ma let me in because itâ€™s a new deviceðŸ˜­
> Been on this s**t now for 2hoursðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–

(This is an obvious red flag, they should have contacted Apple support)

"Anything I can do?"

> It demanding a friend from my Instagram to me log in back to show I'm
> I really need your help to get back into my account back rn

(You shouldn't need an Instagram friend to log into an Apple account)

"Okay"

> A verification link will be released sent to you via sms to recover my account. Copy and paste it here

It's at this point where you will get a link to "recover" this person's account, which when sent will then allow them to reset your password to lock you out.
